\textbf{The Invertible Matrix Theorem}\\
Let $ A $ be a square $ n \times n $ matrix. Then the following statements are equivalent. That is, for a given $ A $, the statements are either all true or all false.

A) $ A $ is an invertible matrix.\\
B) $ A $ is row equivalent to the $ n \times n $ identity matrix.\\
C) $ A $ has $ n $ pivot positions.\\
D) The equation $ Ax=0 $ has only the trivial solution.\\
E) The columns of $ A $ form a linearly independent set.\\
F) The linear transformations $ x |\to Ax $ is one-to-one.
